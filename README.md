# React Chat App

An app I made to better understand Reach related topics. While making this application, I learned about React ie server communication, the use of Redis, Nodejs and Socket.IO.

- In order to use it, your computer must have **Redis** installed.

- You must first install the backend part with `npm install` and start it with `npm start`. Thus, the server will run on port 3000.

- Then you should install the client part in the same way with `npm install` and run it with `npm start`.
